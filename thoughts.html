			I see people everywhere calling groups legends and kings, but they can't back that title up like EXO can. This is pure fact.
			</p>
			<p>
			Yes, I know that EXO, unlike groups like SNSD, BIGBANG and SUJU (and more), have only been together for about 4 and a half years, but that exactly why they deserve that title.

			No kpop artist has been able to sell more than 1 Million since 2001.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not until EXO's XOXO album came out. They became the first million sellers in 12 years.

			Then they had EXODUS, which sold 1 mill faster than XOXO, gaining them the double million seller title.

			Now they've beat themselves again, selling 1 Million ever faster than EXODUS.
		</p>
		<p>
			I know people say EXO have reached their peak but.... why do i feel like they keep "peaking"? (if that makes sense lol)

			I'm just extremely proud of them and honestly fhlkjasdha I FEEL HAPPY WHEN WE MAKE THEM HAPPY YOU KNOW??

			LIKE I CAN SEE SEHUN AND JUNMYEON ACTUALLY PARTYING OVER THIS.

			JKHGLZKSFDLG

		<p>
			My opinion on LOTTO.....
		</p>
		<p>


			'tis lit af. FUEGO MY FRIEND FUEGO. (that means fire for those non-spanish speaking amigos)

			I'm not kidding, I WAS JAMMING SO DAMN HARD ASDHJLFGALHJ

			I WAS SO SCARED THAT I WASN'T GOING TO LIKE IT.
		</p>
		<p>
			WHY?
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of the whole autotune issue, which i never thought would be a big deal.

			Like wtf, I really thought I was going to hate, y'all are so extra.

			I kept seeing bitter people everywhere AND UGH.
		</p>
		<p>
			I AM UTTERLY IN LOVE WITH THEIR AUTOTUNE VOICES.

			I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's get one thing straight, this song would not be as gucci without the autotune. It just will not.

			let me walk you through this.

			You see, EXO is a group who knows how to make gucci music, it's their forte. They have a perfect discography (except the screamo part in mama. that still haunts me)
		</p>
		<p>
			so exo, because they are exo, want to show us a different side to them. They want to prove to the world they can make gucci songs in ANY GENRE.

			They've already proven to us and to the world they are vocal legends, you can't question this. Now they just proved they can sound gucci af even using autotune.
		</p>
		<p>

			exo are the experimental type when it comes to comebacks.

			except, they're the type of scientists that succeed in every experiment (omf i should stop mentioning the screamo)

			.... js
		</p>
		<p>
			"Can't BRring me down" brought me down on the floor crying. im sobbinG AT HOW GUCCI IT SOUNDS.

			THE LITERALLY CAN DO ANY GENRE WTF.

			She's Dreaming literally twisted my heart and put a knife through it. The lyrics arE SO DEPRESSING WTF JONGDAE.

			THE SONG IS SOOOOO GOOD.

			I'M MORE IN LOVE WITH THE CHINESE VERSION THOUGH UMM OOPS

			AND WHEN KYUNGSOO AND BAEKHYUN HARMONIZE AHGFKHJASFGLKJ BLESSSSSSSS.KLASHFGLKJSFD

			UGH THEY ARE JUST LITERAL KINGS

			AKHFKLFJDSK

		<p>
			I am so thankful to have become a part of this fandom and that I'm stanning such a group like EXO. I really hit the lotto for this one.

			anyways, i gotta get ready for school omf see y'all while I'm in class.

			I'll be promoting exo everywhere along the way. I've gotten one girl to stan them last year so I'm sure I can get more.

			<p class="paragraph">Us having to deal with 8t stans. (Btw I really don't like the word stan no matter how much I use it)

			Why is 0t8 even a thing in this fandom?

			It pisses me off bro
			
			<p>I genuinely cannot comprehend how people have the audacity to question Yixing, despite the many times he's always talking about Exo and his love for it,

			despite that he's cried live on stage about not being able to promote and perform with the rest of the members,

			and despite the little tiny things he does, like having cmb as his ringtone, which cutely shows he much he just supports this group called Exo.

			But there are times where His efforts to show us that he is still a part of Exo is so strong, that it is just sad.
			</p>
			<p>
			Does actually have to keep reminding us that he's a part the damn groUP??

			what the actual fudge is wrong y'all??¡?¿

			You know, it's not a secret that 3 members left okay? I'm pretty sure that Yixing is well FRKCING AWARE THAT HES THE ONLY CHINESE MEMBER LEFT

			He never fails to mention and thank Exo and Exo-l during interviews, speeches, and anything really.

			Is this caring act not enough for you?
			</p>
			<p>
			Okay ot8 stans, answer this question:
			How do you think not acknowledging him makes him feel?

			He's a human being (a wonderful one) with emotions and he's a person who works so diligently.

			Yall should be well aware that he's working in China, not just for him but Exo as well
			Yall should be well aware that he's working in China, not just for him but Exo as well.

			Yes, I get it. I also feel a little depressed when he's not on stage with boys. I freaking get it.

			But that just means we need to show him even more support and love.

			"I'm not leaving EXO because of my promise to the other members."
			- Zhang Yixing

			Let's trust his words, okay?
